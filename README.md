React Test Task


* npm install
* This project helps to add , edit , delete, search events for the authorised and unauthorised users.
* Authorised Users should use the credentials for Login .
  Email Address - abc@gmail.com 
  Password - 123456
* After Login, User will watch the events added by him . In the same way the user can edit and delete the list of Events.
* If the user does not wants to login , then the corresponding url is given in the Login page , so that he/she can get into the listing page and do the same functionalities there. But the disadvantage is that once refreshing the page created events of unauthorized users will not get back.
